   <i><b>I’ll bring you three meals every day,</i></b> said the sheep man. <i><b>And at three o’clock I’ll give you doughnuts for your snack. I fry up the doughnuts myself, so they’re crispy and delicious.</i></b>
Fresh doughnuts are one of my all-time favorite things. <br>
<i><b>Okay, so stick out your tootsies.</i></b><br>
I stuck out my feet.<br>
The sheep man pulled a heavy looking ball and chain out from under the bed, wrapped the chain around my ankle, and locked it. He dropped the key into his brest pocket.<br>
<i><b>it feels awfully cold,</i></b> I said. <br>
<i><b>Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Mr. Sheep Man, do I really have to stay here a whole month?</i></b><br>
<i><b>Yep, that’s about the size of it.</i></b><br>
<i><b>But if I memorize everything in these books, he’ll let me out, right?</i></b><br>
<i><b>I don’t think that’ll happen.</i></b><br>
<i><b>But then what will become of me?</i></b><br>
The sheep man cocked his head to one side. <i><b>Wow, that’s a tough one.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Please, tell me. My mother is waiting for me back home.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Okay, kid. Then I’ll give it to you straight. The top of your head’ll be sawed off and all your brains’ll get slurped right up.</i></b><br>
I was too shocked for words. <br>
<i><b>You mean,</i></b> I said, when I had recovered, <i><b>You mean that old man’s going to eat my brains?</i></b><br>
<i><b>Yep, I’m really sorry, but that’s the way it has to be,</i></b> the sheep man said, reluctantly.<br>
