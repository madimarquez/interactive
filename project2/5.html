   <i><b>Just follow me,</i></b> said the old man. <br>
We had gone only a short distance when we came to a fork in the corridor. The old man turned right. A little farther on was another fork. This time he bore left. The corridor forked and forked again, branching off repeatedly, and in every case the old man chose our route with out a moment’s hesitation, swerving first to the right, then to the left. Sometimes he would open a door and we would enter a completely different corridor. <br>
My mind was in turmoil. It was too weird—how could our city library have such an enormous labyrinth in its basement? I mean, public libraries like this one were always short on money, so building even the tiniest of labyrinths had to be beyond their means. I considered asking the old man about this, but I feared that he’d shout at me again.<br>
Finally, the maze came to an end at ta large steel door. Hanging on the door was a sign that read “Reading Room.” The whole area was as quiet as a graveyard in the dead of night.<br>
The old man extracted a jangling ring of keys from his pocket and chose a big old-fashioned one. He inserted it into the keyhole, shot me a brief but meaningful glance, and turned it to the right. There was a loud clunk as the bolt fell into place. The door swung open with a long and nasty screech. 
<br>
<i><b>Well, well. Here we are,</i></b> said the old man. <i><b>In you go.</i></b><br> <i><b>In there?</i></b> I asked.<br> <i><b>That’s the idea.</i></b> <br><i><b>But it’s pitch black,</i></b> I protested. Indeed, inside the door was as dark as if a hold had been pierced in the cosmos.
