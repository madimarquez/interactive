   Sure enough, each of the books had a red label, “For Internal Use Only,” stuck to its spine. 
<i><b>To read them you must use the inner room,</i></b> the old man said. <br>
I glanced at my watch. It was 5:20. <i><b>But the library is about to close, and my mother will be worries if I’m not home in time for dinner.</i></b><br>
The old man’s bushy eyebrows drew together in a single line. <i><b>Closing time is not a concern.</i></b> He frowned. <i><b>They do what I tell them—if I say it’s all right, then it’s all right. The real question is, do you value my assistance or not? Why do you think I lugged these three heavy books out here? For my health?</i></b> <br>
<i><b>I beg your pardon,</i></b> I apologized. <i><b>I never intended to be such a bother. I had no idea the books couldn’t be taken out.</i></b><br>
The old man gave a rumbling cough and spat out a gob of something into a tissue. The black speckles on his face were dancing with rage. <br>
<i><b>It doesn’t matter what you did or didn’t know,</i></b> he snarled. <i><b>When I was your age I felt fortunate just to have the chance to read. And here you are, whining about the time and being late for dinner. What nerve!</i></b><br>
<i><b>All right. I’ll stay and read,</i></b> I said. <i><b>But just for thirty minutes.” I’m not very good at giving anyone a clear no. <i><b>But I really can’t stay any longer than that. When I was very small, I was bitten by a big black dog on my way home from school, and ever since then my mother starts acting strange if I’m even a little bit late.</i></b><br>
The old man’s face relaxed slightly.<br>
<i><b>So then you’ll stay and read?</i></b><br>
<i><b>Yes. But only for thirty minutes.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Then please step right this was,” the old man beckoned. Beyond the inner door was a shadowy corridor lit by a single flickering bulb. We stepped into the dying light.
