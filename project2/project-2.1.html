    <h1>The Strange Library</h1>
    <h2>Haruki Murakami</h2>
  <p><b>1. Find a printed text from the library, scan it and save it as a pdf. Once you’ve chosen this text, read it multiple times, and write a short response to this text. What is it about? Pay close attention to how the text was written—word choices, tone, etc. Are metaphors used? Is the text descriptive? How are nouns and adjectives used? </b>
    <br>

The book is about a boy who goes to the library to check out a book on the Ottoman
Empire. He is directed to room 107 in the basement by an old man at the library. There he is imprisoned until he can read the books given to him and answer questions about the text to the old man. He meets a sheep man and a girl who can’t speak, and they plan their escape. It is a wildly confusing story in the sense that you don’t really know what is happening. Especially with the last page it makes you go and re read the book. The last page tells the reader that the mom passed away the week before quietly and it makes me think that the library and its basement of horrors was a figment of the boy’s imagination to deal with the fact that his mother was passing away. One thing I noticed in the book on the way that the text is set up is about the dialogue from the girl who can’t speak. She speaks with her hands apparently and her dialogue is in a blue color, which is the only time this color appears in the book. Because the boy accepts the strange things that are happening as they are the descriptions are not as in detail for those not physically there. The description of the sheepman for example is interesting because it just says a man with sheep skin on him. Which I am curious as to why the boy is not freaking out about it or describing the grossness of it.

<b>2.  Based on how you interpreted the text, what do you want to point out to the reader in your browser-based design?</b>
<br>
The creepiness even though apparently it is a children’s book, I looked this part up. I also like the different colors for the dialogue. I wonder if I could do that with all of them, so it brings more attention to the details, or lack thereof. So, the viewer is just as perplexed as me.
