   It was a real sheepskin, and it covered every inch of the sheep man’s body. There was an opening for the face, however, through which peeped a friendly pair of eyes. The costume suited him well. The sheep man looked at me for a moment; then his eyes shifted to the three books in my hand. <br>
<i><b>Holy Moly, you came here to read, for real?</i></b><br>
<i><b>That’s right,</i></b> I answered.<br>
<i><b>You mean you really and truly came to read those books?</i></b><br>
There was something strange about the sheep man’s way of speaking. I found myself at a loss for words. <br>
<i><b>Come on, out with it,</i></b>the old man demanded. <i><b>You came here to read, is that not a fact? Give him a straight answer.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Yes. I came here to read.</i></b><br>
<i><b>You heard him,</i></b> the old man crowed.<br>
<i><b>But, sir,</i></b> said the sheep man. <i><b>He’s only a kid.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Silence!</i></b> thundered the old man. He drew a willow switch from his back pocket and whipped the sheep man across his face. <i><b>Take him to the Reading Room now!</i></b><br>
The sheep man looked troubled, but he took my hand anyway. The switch had left a red welt next to his lip. <i><b>Okay, let’s get going.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Where?</i></b><br>
<i><b>To the Reading Room. You came to read those books, didn’t you?</i></b><br>
<br><br>
The sheep man led me down a narrow hallway. The old man followed close behind us. There was a short tail attached to the back of the sheep man’s outfit that bounced from side to side with each step, like a pendulum.<br>
<i><b>Well, well,</i></b> said the sheep man, when we reached the end of the hallway. <i><b>Here we are.</i></b>
<i><b>Just a minute, Mr. Sheep Man,</i></b> I said. <i><b>Is this by any chance a jail cell?</i></b><br>
<i><b>Sure is,</i></b> he replied.<br>
<i><b>You hit the nail on the head,</i></b> said the old man.
