   This made me squirm. To tell the truth. I wasn’t all that eager to learn about the ottoman tax collection- the topic had just popped into my head on my way home from school. As in, I wonder how did the Ottomans collect taxes? Like that. And ever since I was little my mother had told me, if you don’t know something, go to the library and look it up. <br>
<i><b>Please don’t bother,</i></b> I said. <i><b>It’s really not that important. It is pretty academic, after all…</i></b> I just wanted to get out of that creepy room as quickly as possible. <br>
<i><b>Don’t trifle with me,</i></b> the old man snapped. <i><b>We possess a number of volumes that deal with tax collection in the Ottoman Empire. Did you come here with the intention of having sport with this library? Was that you aim?</i></b><br>
<i><b>No, sir,</i></b> I sputtered. <br>
<i><b>That was not my intention at all. I wasn’t trying to make fun of anything.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Then wait here for me like a good buy.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Yes, sir</i></b> I replied.<br>
The old man lurched from his chair. Back bent, he made his way to a steel door at the rear if the room, opened it, and disappeared. I stood there for ten minutes waiting for his return. Some tiny black bugs were scratching about on the underside of the lampshade. <br>
At long last the old man returned, carrying three fat books. They were all terribly old- the smell of ancient paper rose in the air.<br>
<i><b>Feast your eyes on these,” </i></b>the old man said, gloating. <i><b>We have The Ottoman Tax System, The Diary of an Ottoman Tax Collector, and Tax Revolt and Their Suppression in the Ottoman-Turkish Empire. An impressive collection you must admit.</i></b><br>
“Thank you so much,” I said politely. I picked up the books and headed for the door. <br>
“Hold your horses,” the old man called out to my back. <i><b>Those three books have to be read here—under no circumstances may they leave these premises.</i></b>
