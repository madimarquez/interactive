 The old man turned to me and drew himself up to his full height. Now, suddenly, he was big. The eyes beneath the bushy eyebrows flashed like a goat’s eyes at twilight. <br>
<i><b>Are you the sort of boy who finds fault with every little thing, however trivial?</i></b> <br>
<i><b>No sir. I’m not like that at all. But it seems to me that—</i></b><br>
<i><b>Enough of your prattle,</i></b> the old man said. <i><b>I cannot abide people who conjure up a raft of excuses, disparaging the efforts of those who have gone out of their way to help them. Such people are common trash.</i></b> <br>
<i><b>Please forgive me,</i></b> I apologized. <i><b>I’ll go in.</i></b><br>
Why do I act like this, agreeing when I really disagree, letting people force me to do things I don’t want to do?<br>
<i><b>There’s a stairway right on the other side of this door,</i></b> the old man said. <i><b>Hold tight o the railing so you don’t take a tumble.</i></b><br>
I went in first, inching my way along. When the old man closed the door behind us, all went completely dark. I could hear the click as he turned the lock.<br>
<i><b>Why did you lock the door?</i></b><br>
<i><b>Those are the rules. It must stay locked at all times.</i></b><br>
What could I do? I began my decent. It was a very long staircase. Long enough, it seemed, to reach Brazil. The handrail was flaky with rust. Not a ray of light anywhere.<br>
Finally, we reached the bottom of the staircase. I could see a glimmer farther in, just a feeble glow, really, but still strong enough to make my eyes hurt after the long darkness. Someone approached me from the back of the room and took my hand. A small man clad in the skin of a sheep.<br>
<i><b>Hey, thanks for coming,</i></b> the sheep man said.<br>
<i><b>Good afternoon,</i></b> I replied
