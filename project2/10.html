   I sat down on the bed and buried my head in my hands. Why did something like this have to happen to me? All I did was go to the library to borrow some books.<br>
<i><b>Don’t take it so hard,</i></b> the sheep man consoled me. “I’ll bring you some food. A nice hot meal will cheer you up.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Mr. Sheep Man,</i></b> I asked, <i><b>Why would that old man want to eat my brains?</i></b><br>
<i><b>Because brains packed with knowledge are yummy, that’s why. They’re nice and creamy. Ans sort of grainy at the same time.</i></b><br>
<i><b>So that’s why he want me to spend a month cramming information in there, to suck it up afterword?</i></b><br>
<i><b>That’s the idea.</i></b><br>
<i><b>Don’t you think that’s awfully cruel?</i></b> I asked. <i><b>Speaking from the suckee’s point of view, of course.</i></b><br>
<i><b>But, hey, this kind of thing’s going on in libraries everywhere, you know. More or less, that is.</i></b><br>
This news staggered me. <br>
<i><b>In libraries everywhere?</i></b> I stammered<br>
<i><b>If all they did was lend out knowledge for free, what would the payoff be for them?</i></b><br>
<i><b>But that doesn’t give them the right to saw off the tops of people’s heads and eat their brains. Don’t you think that’s going a bit too far?</i></b><br>
The sheep man looked at me sadly. <i><b>You got dealt an unlucky card, that’s he long and short of it. These things happen.</i></b><br>
<i><b>But my mother's going to worry herself sick waiting for me. Can’t you help me sneak out of this place?</i></b><br>
<i><b>No, that wouldn’t work. If I did that, I’d be chucked into a jar full of hairy caterpillars. A big jar, with about ten thousand of the buggers crawling around, for three whole days.</i></b><br>
<i><b>That’s terrible,</i></b> I said.<br>
<i><b>So, you see, I can’t let you make a run for it, kid. I’m real sorry.</i></b>
