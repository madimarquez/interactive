   <i><b>Don’t you have a voice?</i></b> I asked her. <br>
<i class="p">No, I don’t. My vocal cords were destroyed when I was little.</i> <br>
<i><b>Destroyed?</i></b> I cried in surprise. <i><b>By whom?</i></b><br>
She didn’t answer. Instead, she smiled sweetly. It was a smile so radiant that the air seemed to thin around it.<br>
<i class="p">Please understand,</i> she said. <i class="p">The sheep man isn’t bad. He has a kind heart. But the old man terrifies him.</i><br>
<i><b>I understand,</i></b> I said. <i><b>But still…</i></b><br>
She drew near me and placed her hand on mind. It was a small soft hand. I thought my heart might break in two.<br>
<i class="p">Eat it while it’s hot,</i> she said. Hot food will give you strength.<br>
She opened the door and left the room, pushing the teacart in front of her. Her movements were as quick and light as a May breeze.<br>
<br>
The food was delicious, but I could get only half of it down. If I didn’t make it home, the worry might drive my mother to another breakdown. She would probably forget to feed my pet starling, and it would starve to death.<br>
  Yet how could I escape? A heavy ball and chain was attached to my ankle, and the door was locked. Even if I managed to open the door, could I make it through that long maze of corridors? I sighed and started to cry again. But curling up in bed wasn’t going to help, so I pulled myself together and finished my meal.
