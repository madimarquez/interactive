    I descended a long flight of stairs, turned right, and walked along a gloomy corridor until, sure enough. I came to a door marked 107. I visited the library a lot, but the fact that it had a basement was news to me. <br>
I knocked. It was just a normal, everyday knock, yet it sounded as if someone had whacked the gates of hell with a baseball bat. It echoed ominously in the corridor. I turned to run, but I didn’t actually take a step, even though I wanted to. That wasn’t the way I was raised. My mother taught me that if you knock on a door, you have to wait there until someone answers.<br>
<i><b>Come in,</i></b> said a voice from inside. It was low but penetrating. <br>
I opened the door. <br>
A little old man sat behind a little old desk in the middle of the room. Tiny black spots dotted is face like a swarm of flies. The old man was bald and wore glasses with thick lenses. His baldness looked incomplete: he has frizzy white hairs plastered against both sides of his head. It looked like a mountain after a big forest fire. <br>
<i><b>Welcome, my boy,</i></b> said the old man. <i><b>How may I be of assistance?</i></b><br>
<i><b>I was looking for some books,</i></b> I said timidly. <i><b>But I can see that you’re busy. I’ll come back some other time…</i></b><br>
<i><b>Nonsense, my boy,</i></b> the old man replied. <i><b>This is my profession-I am never too busy! Tell me the manner of books that you seek, and I will strive to locate their whereabouts.</i></b><br>
What a funny way of talking, I thought. And his face was every bit as strange. A few long hairs sprouted from his ears. Skin dangled beneath his chin like a punctured balloon. <br>
<i><b>And what exactly might you be seeking, my young friend</i></b><br>
<i><b>I want to learn how taxes were collected in the Ottoman Empire,</i></b> I said. <br>
The old man’s eyes glittered. <i><b>Ah, I see,</i></b> he said. <i><b>Tax collection in the Ottoman Empire. A fascinating subject if there ever was one!</i></b>
