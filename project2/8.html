  <i><b>This isn’t what you told me,</i></b> I said to the old man. <i><b>I came this far only because you told me we were going to a reading room.</i></b><br>
<i><b>You got taken,</i></b> the sheep man said, and nodded.<br>
<i><b>That’s right, I pulled the wool over your eyes,</i></b> said the old man.<br>
<i><b>How could you…</i></b><br>
<i><b>Silence, you fool,</i></b> the old man snarled, pulling the willow switch from his pocket and brandishing it over my head. I quickly stepped back. Now way I wanted my face whipped by that thing. <br>
<i><b>In you go-no more arguments. You will memorize these three volumes from cover to cover,</i></b> the old man said. <i><b>One month from now I will personally examine you. If I conclude that you have mastered their contents completely, then I will set you free.</i></b><br>
<i><b>It’s impossible to memorize three books as thick as these,</i></b> I said. <i><b>And my mother is getting pretty worries about me right about now…</i></b><br>
The old man bared his teeth and brought the switch down hard. I jumped out of the way, and the blow struck the sheep man in the face. Enraged, the old man whipped the sheep man again. It was awfully unfair. <br>
<i><b>Throw him in the cell. I leave it to you,</i></b> the old man ordered, and let.<br>
<i><b>Are you hurt?</i></b> I asked the sheep man.<br>
<i><b>It’s okay. Hey, I’m used to it,</i></b> he said. He really did seem to be all right.<br>
<i><b>I hate to do this, but I got to lock you up.</i></b><br>
<i><b>What if I say no, if I refuse to go in there? What happens then?</i></b><br>
<i><b>Then he’ll hit me even harder.</i></b><br>
I felt sorry for the sheep an, so I entered the cell. It had a simple bed, a desk, a sink, and a flush toilet. A toothbrush and a cup sat beside the sink. Neither looked what you would call clean. The toothpaste was strawberry, a flavor I can’t stand. The sheep man was playing with the desk lamp, switching it on and off. <br>
<i><b>Hey, look at this,</i></b> he said turning to me with a grin. <i><b>Pretty neat, huh?</i></b>
