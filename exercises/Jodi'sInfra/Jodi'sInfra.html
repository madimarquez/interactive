  I was always under the impression that websites and anything on the web was meant to focus on functionality. It was very interesting to then read this and have this idea challenged. I think JODI challenges this with their many websites that serve no other function except to exist. I mean I certainly had fun clicking away at their websites. My favorites were the websites, LinhedIn.com, Vodacone.com, YouTuhb.com because they were fun to look at. I would be confused if I left this tab open and saw the logo click on it and it was just flashing white. It’s funny because I probably have spelled LinkedIn like that at some point, and I would be very confused if that’s where it took me instead of the intended destination.
 When talking about the importance of mediums this quotation stuck out to me, “Here “art” is an entirely self-referential activity, and beauty is defined through the virtues of functionality, elegance, and simplicity.“. My interpretation of what it is saying is that something is not “beautiful” until it is useful and easy to understand. It stuck out to me because I think this is how I view art, as something that is purposeful, to evoke an emotion, for example, or for understanding of something. This article made me take a step back and look at the whole picture. I want to incorporate this thinking into my art. There are times when a design needs to be legible and easy to understand but I want to experiment with things that just look fun and just for enjoyment.
Another quotation that stood out to me was talking about Jodi’s modernism the author says, “it suspends the distinction between art and technology without making one subservient to the other.” I think this is compelling because in a time where technology is becoming ever more prevalent in our daily lives, we ourselves can become subservient to technology. Finding a middle ground with art and technology is then very important and sought after.
